  // We can define functions in a 'computed' key with object value, and
  // we can then use the functions of this object to access these
  // values as if they were data values.  The idea is to compute
  // new data from our data that we will display... rather than
  // cluttering our interpolations with too much logic.
  //
  // - Vue is aware of the dependency between the property and the
  // computed property and will update it accordingly.
  //
  // - Computed properties are *cached* which means they only get
  // calculated as needed (as the dependent data changes).  This is
  // why we don't just want to call a regular JavaScript method in
  // our interpolations, for example.
  //
